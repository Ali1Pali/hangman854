# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer chooses a random word from a list and the user tries to guess it. 

The code is run using the play_game function in milestone_5.py, using the desired list of words as the argument. The player has 5 lives, so if 5 guesses are incorrect, the game is over.
Once the game is over, the player will be prompted to play again using the same word list, by entering Y or N.
